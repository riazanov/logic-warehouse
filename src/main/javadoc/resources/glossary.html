  <li> <a name="backward_paramodulation"><b>Backward paramodulation</b>.
  We consider two modes in which paramodulation is applied.
  In the backward mode, the <a href="#candidate_redex">candidate redexes</a>
  are in a database (index)
  and the positive equality to 
  <a href="#paramodulation_from_into">paramodulate from</a>
  acts as a query.
  In <a href="#forward_paramodulation">forward paramodulation</a>,
  the positive equalities to paramodulate from are in a databse,
  and the candidate redex term acts as a query.
  <em>The distinction is purely technical</em>,
  the semantics of paramodulation is not affected. 



  <li> <a name="candidate_redex"><b>Candidate redex</b> is a term that
  is identified as a potential <a href="#redex">redex</a> in paramodulation
  or demodulation inferences.

  <li> <a name="complex_literal"><b>Complex literals</b> are those literals
  whose atoms are not atomic formulas, ie, they are applications
  of quantifiers or conjunctions. In Alabai, all complex literals
  are considered positive even if the corresponding atoms are applications
  of negation. See also <a href="#ordinary_literal">ordinary literal</a>.

  <li> <a name="forward_paramodulation"><b>Forward paramodulation</b>.
  We consider two modes in which paramodulation is applied.
  In the forward mode, the positive equality to 
  <a href="#paramodulation_from_into">paramodulate from</a>
  is taken from the database (index) and 
  the <a href="#candidate_redex">candidate redex</a> term
  acts as a query. 
  In <a href="#backward_paramodulation">backward paramodulation</a>,
  the positive equality acts a query, and the candidate redexes are
  in a database (index). <em>The distinction is purely technical</em>,
  the semantics of paramodulation is not affected.

  <li> <a name="gamma_substitution"><b>Gamma-substitution</b> is 
  any substitution &theta, such that for every variable x, 
  x&theta is a constant or a variable, and if x and y are distinct
  variables and x&theta and y&theta are variables, then 
  x&theta and y&theta are distinct.

  <li> <a name="paramodulation_from_into"> 
  <b>Paramodulation from ... into ...</b>
  Given an application of paramodulation between the clauses 
  <code>C \/ s = t and D[s]</code>, resulting in <code>C \/ D[t]</code>, 
  we say that we <em>paramodulate from</em> the positive equality s = t 
  <em>into</em> the clause <code>D[s]</code>.


<center><font size=5><b>R</b></font></center> <br>

  <li> <a name="redex"> <b>Redex</b>.
  Given an application of paramodulation between the clauses 
  <code>C \/ s = t</code> and <code>D[s]</code>, resulting in 
  <code>C \/ D[t]</code>, we say that the term 
  <code>s</code> acts as a <em>redex</em> in this inference. 
  Similarly, in the demodulation
  between <code>s = t</code> and <code>D[s]</code>, <code>s</code> 
  is the redex.

  <li> <a name="shallow_weight"> <b>Shallow weight</b> of a term is 
  a weight polynomial which is computed just like regular weight
  except that only symbols down to some specified depth are considered.
  Comparison of terms by their shallow weights is stable w.r.t.
