This is Logic Warehouse library for Java - a collection of reusable datastructures and algorithms for first order predicate logic (FOL).

The datastructures include representations for:
-- atomic formulas and literals;
-- connectives;
-- arbitrary FOL formulas;
-- symbols: variables, individual constants, function and predicate constants, connectives and quantifiers;
-- terms (tree-like terms and flatterms);
-- substitutions;
-- weight polynomials.


The algorithms and relevant abstractions include:
-- one-to-one forward and backward subsumption tests on clauses (lists of literals);
-- propositional factoring and tautology tests on clauses (lists of literals);
-- clustered unification indexing;
-- feature vector indexing;
-- flatterm and tree-like term assembly;
-- variable renaming;
-- reduction and literal orderings;
-- non-recursive Knuth-Bendix ordering; 
-- subterm relation as reduction ordering; 
-- unification;
-- heuristic unifiability estimation;
-- weight computation.
